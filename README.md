### Thanks
While this is technically a fork of [OpenC64Cart](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenC64Cart), it was also very helpful to look at the design of Bwack's [Vers64Cart](https://github.com/bwack/Versa64Cart). A ton of credit also needs to go to the [World Of Jani](http://blog.worldofjani.com/) blog for both the [diagnostic images](http://blog.worldofjani.com/?p=164) and [code](http://blog.worldofjani.com/?p=1981), as well a ton of [documentation](http://blog.worldofjani.com/?p=879) on how these cartridges work.
